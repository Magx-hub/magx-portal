Create user-based routes for teachers and admins
Teacher should be routed to students. They should ONLY be able to manage students and performance-monitor.
Admin should be able to access all parts of the app.

Teachers should have predefined passwords, to be able to access the app.
So, the app should store in a javascript or json file, a dictionary of teachers and their passwords.
On the home screen, there should be two options to choose from (SELECT YOUR ROLE) -> If teacher: route to teachers-home-page with teacher names -> when a name is selected, then password input shows up. If the data supplied is correct, then teachers page shows up.

Same logic for admin.
