## ðŸš€ Production Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Manual GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for production deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**:
   ```bash
   yarn deploy
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**:
   - Go to `https://Magx-hub.github.io/magx-portal`
   - Test PWA installation on mobile/desktop
   - Verify Firebase connectivity

### Option 2: Firebase Hosting (Alternative)

1. **Install Firebase CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login and Initialize**:
